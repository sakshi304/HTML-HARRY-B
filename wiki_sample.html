        This article is about the Greek goddess. For other uses, see Selene (disambiguation).

In Greek mythology, Selene (/sɪˈliːniː/; Ancient Greek: Σελήνη, romanized: Selḗnē, lit. '"Moon"', 
Greek pronunciation: [selɛ̌ːnɛː]) is the goddess of the Moon. She is the daughter of the Titans 
Hyperion and Theia, and sister of the sun god Helios and the dawn goddess Eos. She drives her moon 
chariot across the heavens. Several lovers are attributed to her in various myths, including Zeus, 
Pan, and the mortal Endymion. In post-classical times, Selene was often identified with Artemis, much
 as her brother, Helios, was identified with Apollo.[2] Selene and Artemis were also associated with 
 Hecate and all three were regarded as moon and lunar goddesses, but only Selene was regarded as the 
 personification of the Moon itself. Her Roman equivalent is Luna.

        The name "Selene" is derived from the Greek noun selas (σέλας), meaning "light, brightness,gleam".[5]

    Selene was also called Mene.[6] The Greek word mene, meant the moon, and the lunar month.[7] 
    The    masculine form of mene (men) was also the name of the Phrygian moon-god Men.[8] The Greek 
    Stoic    philosopher Chrysippus interpreted Selene and Men as, respectively, the female and male 
    aspects of     the same god.[9]

    Just as Helios, from his identification with Apollo, is called Phoebus ("bright"), Selene, from
    her     identification with Artemis, is also called Phoebe (feminine form).[10] Also from
    Artemis, Selene was   sometimes called "Cynthia".[11]

    <h3>Parents</h3>

        The usual account of Selene's origin is given by Hesiod in his Theogony, where the sun-god Hyperion
        espoused his sister Theia, who gave birth to "great Helios and clear Selene and Eos who shines upon 
        all that are on earth and upon the deathless Gods who live in the wide heaven".[12] The Homeric Hymn
        to Helios follows this tradition: "Hyperion wedded glorious Euryphaëssa, his own sister, who bare him
        lovely children, rosy-armed Eos and rich-tressed Selene and tireless Helios",[13] with Euryphaëssa
        ("widely shining") probably being an epithet of Theia.[14] However, the Homeric Hymn to Hermes has
         Selene as the daughter of Pallas, the son of an otherwise unknown Megamedes.[15] This Pallas is
        possibly identified with the Pallas, who, according to Hesiod's Theogony, was the son of the Titan
        Crius, and thus Selene's cousin.[16] Other accounts give still other parents for Selene: Euripides
        has Selene as the daughter of Helios (rather than sister),[17] while an Aeschylus fragment possibly
        has Selene as the daughter of Leto.[18]
